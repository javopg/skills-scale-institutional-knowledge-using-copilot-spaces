# OctoAcme Onboarding Notes

Welcome to the OctoAcme team! This document provides quick-start guidance for new team members.

---

## Where to Find Key Artifacts

- **Project README:** Start here for project overview, setup instructions, and links to key resources.
- **Process Documentation:** All project management process docs are in the `docs/` directory. See [docs/README.md](README.md) for the full list.
- **Copilot Context:** Project-specific documentation and guides are stored in `.copilot/` to help Copilot Spaces provide relevant, context-aware suggestions.
- **Issue Templates:** Use templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for consistent issue creation and tracking.

---

## Team Cadence

- **Daily Standups:** Twice weekly (or as agreed per project). Share progress, blockers, and next steps.
- **Sprint Planning:** At the start of each sprint. Review backlog, estimate work, and commit to sprint goals.
- **Sprint Reviews/Demos:** At the end of each sprint. Showcase completed work to stakeholders.
- **Retrospectives:** After each sprint or release. Reflect on what went well and what to improve.
- **Weekly PM + PdM Sync:** Align on priorities, roadmap updates, and upcoming milestones.
- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates:** Share progress, upcoming features, and key decisions.

## How to Request Process Changes

If you have suggestions for improving our processes or documentation:

1. Use the issue template at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml`
2. Describe the gap or improvement opportunity
3. Provide specific suggestions or examples
4. Tag relevant stakeholders for review

We encourage everyone to contribute to process improvements!
